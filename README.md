# StevesChordTool

I made a tool to help me quickly find and develop chord progressions. I mostly use it to 
either reverse engineer a chord progression by ear or to write my own chord progressions for
music I write myself.

With this tool you can navigate various chords available in the desired key and see them 
on the piano and various fretted string instruments (currently I support Mandolin, Guitar, 
Ukelele, and 5-string Banjo)
